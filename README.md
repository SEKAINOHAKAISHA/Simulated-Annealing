This is a demo of Simulated Annealing using coin toss example.

Basically in Simulated Annealing, the value of a higher variable is brought down little by little till our system is in equilibrium

the values are brought down such that energy function minimizes in our example, the value by which the higher probability is brought down is called the "temperature" which is random in a nature such that it only brings higher probability lower 


at the end, we get probability of heads and tails in a coin toss which is optimal or close to optimal that is 0.5

Further Idea : Implement Simulating Annealing on Dices
